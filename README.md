# BJump

This was a game developed for a Hackathon at our university, the main theme was about an application to distract/entertain all the programmers in the Hackathon.

After brainstorming for a bit, we end up choosing to make a game about jumping into platforms with the objective of getting as high as possible.

Some of the features of the game:
 - Singleplayer and multiplayer using [Prothon PUN 2](https://doc.photonengine.com/pun/current/getting-started/pun-intro)
 - Power-ups (Boost jump, freeze, slow-mo)
 - Multiplatform

You can play it yourself at [BJump](https://alexandru-d6.github.io/BJump/).

All the source code is available in the [Root](./) folder, and you can easily import it to unity using the version 6000.0.37f1. Newer version should also work, but they have not been tested.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The initial scene is [Loading Scene](/Assets/Scenes/LoadingScene.unity)
